# Changelog

All notable changes to VLSub OpenSubtitles.com extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0-beta] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- **SubSource Subtitle Search & API Integration**: Integrated SubSource.net as a primary subtitle provider alongside OpenSubtitles.com with direct search and pagination support (`Show more` results).
- **SubSource Rate Limiting & Usage Tracking**: Implemented client-side API rate limit tracking (per minute, hour, day) to stay within SubSource limit thresholds.
- **SubSource Security & Log Masking**: Added API key validation, direct account dashboard link, and automatic masking of API keys in debug logs.
- **SubSource API Key UI Layout**: Consolidated SubSource API Key help link and input field onto a single row to optimize configuration dialog spacing.
- **AI Audio Transcription Support**: Initial preview integration for local audio transcription with Whisper AI models (`tiny.en`, `base.en`).
- **Simple CI and smoke testing setup**: Added a simple CI and smoke testing setup on GitHub Actions on push and pull requests to main for the extension.

### Fixed
- **Buffer & Timestamp Transitions**: Fixed timestamp shifting, seek-back resume, and buffer underrun errors during subtitle transcription.
- **Playlist State Tracking**: Prevented unintended playlist resume by tracking playback state during subtitle buffering transitions.
- **Local File URI Resolution**: Resolved local file URIs to native Windows paths and updated FFmpeg downloading to use fast BtbN mirrors.
- **SRT & Formatting Stability**: Corrected SRT regex escaping, Lua `%%` format string escaping, cached subtitles variable references, and I/O caching for enhanced stability.
- **PowerShell Installer Fixes**: Explicitly cast integer values for PowerShell `-f D2/D3` format specifiers.

## [1.2.9] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Network share / UNC path handling** ([#32](https://github.com/opensubtitles/vlsub-opensubtitles-com/issues/32)): subtitles for media on Windows network shares (`\\server\share\...`) and SMB/CIFS/NFS protocols now save next to the video file instead of falling back to the Downloads folder. The hostname is preserved from `file://server/share/path` URIs and reconstructed as `//server/share/path` before path resolution.

## [1.2.8] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Incompatible dkjson dialog**: error dialog now includes Ubuntu/Debian-specific workaround. Distro-bundled VLC ships an old `dkjson.luac` that VLC upgrades do not fix; dialog now explains how to replace it with the latest version from dkolf.de ([#23](https://github.com/opensubtitles/vlsub-opensubtitles-com/issues/23)).

### Documentation
- README troubleshooting now covers the Ubuntu/Debian dkjson fix with full step-by-step instructions.

### Planned
- Package manager support (Homebrew, apt, etc.)
- Subtitle preview before download
- Batch download for TV series
- Custom subtitle styling
- Integration with popular media centers
